# ðŸ¤– NeuralScript.js  

## **Lightweight AI Framework for JavaScript**  

NeuralScript.js is an advanced **JavaScript-based neural network framework** that allows developers to implement **machine learning models directly within web applications**. It is designed for real-time AI use cases, including **predictive analytics, natural language processing, and image classification**, without requiring backend servers.

## ðŸš€ **Features**  
âœ… **Client-Side AI Processing** â€“ No backend required for ML execution.  
âœ… **Customizable Neural Networks** â€“ Build & train models dynamically.  
âœ… **WebGL & WebAssembly Optimization** â€“ Leverages GPU acceleration.  
âœ… **Lightweight & Fast** â€“ Optimized for low-latency performance.  
âœ… **Pre-trained Models Support** â€“ Import and fine-tune existing models.  
âœ… **Seamless Integration** â€“ Works with React, Vue, and vanilla JavaScript.

## ðŸ”§ **Installation**  
To install NeuralScript.js in your project, run:  
```sh
npm install neuralscript.js  

import NeuralScript from 'neuralscript.js';  

const model = new NeuralScript.Model({  
    inputNodes: 3,  
    hiddenLayers: [5],  
    outputNodes: 1  
});  

const trainingData = [  
    { input: [0, 0, 1], output: [0] },  
    { input: [1, 1, 1], output: [1] },  
    { input: [1, 0, 1], output: [1] },  
    { input: [0, 1, 1], output: [0] }  
];  

model.train(trainingData, { epochs: 1000, learningRate: 0.01 });  

console.log(model.predict([1, 0, 0]));
